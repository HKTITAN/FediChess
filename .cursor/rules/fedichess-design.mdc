# FediChess design

Apply these principles when changing UI, layout, or motion:

- **Simplicity**: One primary focus per view. Use tray/overlay flows for secondary actions (e.g. settings, copy link). Progressive disclosure; avoid crowding the main screen.
- **Fluidity**: Smooth, purposeful transitions (e.g. view changes, modals). Reuse or morph elements for continuity. Avoid static jumps and redundant or decorative animation.
- **Delight**: Polish and small surprises in high-impact moments (e.g. landing CTA, move confirmation, game end). Avoid sprinkling motion everywhere; follow a delight–impact curve.

**Typography**: Instrument Serif for brand and headings. Keep body text in a neutral sans for readability.

**Reference**: For typography, color, and motion details see `.agents/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md`. Use FediChess design principles as the project design language.
