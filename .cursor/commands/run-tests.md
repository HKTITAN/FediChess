# Run tests

Run the project test script (`npm test` or `pnpm test`). If there are failures, fix them. If no test script exists, run the build (e.g. `npm run build`) and fix any type or lint errors. Focus on the files or area the user specified after the command if they provided context (e.g. `/run-tests components/game`).

Report what was run and the outcome (passed/failed, and any fixes made).
