# Review UI

Review the current or specified UI (page or component) against FediChess design principles and accessibility.

Check:
- One primary focus per view; clear hierarchy
- Keyboard and screen-reader considerations
- Color contrast and readability
- FediChess design principles: simplicity (tray/overlay for secondaries), fluidity (purposeful transitions), delight (high-impact moments only)

Suggest concrete changes based on FediChess design principles and accessibility.
