# Add component

Add a new React component for the name or feature the user gives. Use the existing `components/` structure (e.g. `components/game/`, `components/ui/`). Follow composition patterns: avoid boolean props for variants; use explicit variant types where needed. Add the component in the right place and wire it into the app if the user asked for it. Use `@/` for imports and follow project conventions (see `.cursor/rules/conventions.mdc`).
