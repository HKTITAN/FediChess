# FediChess design

Apply when changing UI, layout, or motion in the app.

## Principles

- **Simplicity**: One primary focus per view. Use tray/overlay for secondary actions (settings, copy link). Progressive disclosure; avoid crowding the main screen.
- **Fluidity**: Smooth, purposeful transitions (view changes, modals). Reuse or morph elements for continuity. Avoid static jumps and redundant or decorative animation.
- **Delight**: Polish and small surprises in high-impact moments (landing CTA, move confirmation, game end). Avoid sprinkling motion everywhere; follow a delight–impact curve.

## Typography and brand

- **Instrument Serif** for brand and headings (e.g. main "FediChess" title, section headings).
- Body text: neutral sans for readability.
- Reference `.agents/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md` for typography, color, and motion details. FediChess design principles are the project design language.

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks to change or add UI, layout, animations, or styling in FediChess (landing, lobby, game, or shared components).
